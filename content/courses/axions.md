## Course Description

Axions and axion-like-particles are well-motivated candidates for beyond the Standard Model particles, as well as dark matter. Thus, they are subject to extensive theoretical and experimental research in recent years. This course aims to introduce students to different aspects of axion physics. In order to understand the motivation behind axions, we will also cover some advanced field theory topics. After completing the course, the students will be able to follow the recent axion literature, and be prepared for research in the area.
